# IPL-win-probability-predictor
I’ve built a small yet powerful IPL Win Probability Predictor, which analyzes real-time match conditions and predicts the chances of a team winning. This model is designed using:
✅ Statistics & Probability – To evaluate match dynamics
✅ Mathematics & Machine Learning – To compute real-time probabilities
✅ Key Match Factors – Required Run Rate, Wickets in Hand, Current Run Rate, and more!
